## About the project
`Python for RAW Sentinel-2 data (PyRawS)` is a powerful open-source Python package that provides a comprehensive set of tools for working with [Sentinel-2 Raw data](#sentinel-2-raw-data)🔬.
<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>
It provides utilities for coarse spatial bands coregistration, geo-referencing, data visualization📊, and image processing🖼️.
The software is demonstrated on the first Sentinel-2 🛰️ Raw database for warm temperature hotspots 🔥 detection/classification, making it an ideal tool for a wide range of applications in remote sensing and earth observation🌍.
The package is written in Python and is open source💻, making it easy to use and modify for your specific needs.
The systme is based on [pytorch]("https://pytorch.org/"), which be installed with `CUDA` support, to enable GPU acceleation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> NB: What we call raw data in this project are Sentinel-2 data generated by the decompression and metadata addition of Sentinel-2 L0 data. Because of that, with the exception of the effects due to onboard equalization and lossy compression, they are the most similar version of the rawest form of data acquired by the satellite's sensors. Both the compression and equalization are applied onboard the satellite to reduce the amount of data transmitted to the ground station. For easy naming convention, this repo refer to the term "Raw" as the products decompressed with ancillary information appended. For further information browse our paper at https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11891 <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></li>

## Sidenote: Sentinel-2 Raw granules and events

![Alt Text](resources/images/etna_00_granules.png)

Downloading [Sentinel-2 Raw data](#sentinel-2-raw-data) requires to specify a polygon surrounding the area of interest and a date. Given the pushbroom nature of the [Sentinel-2](https://sentinel.esa.int/documents/247904/685211/sentinel-2-products-specification-document) sensor, bands of data at  [Raw](#sentinel-2-raw-data) level do not look at the same area (i.e., they are not registered). Therefore,to be sure to collect all the band around an event (i.e., volcanic eruptions, wildfires) rectangular polygons centered on the events of area 28x10 $km^2$ are used (white rectangular in the image above). This leads to download all the [Raw granules](#sentinel-2-raw-granule) whose reference band (`B02`) interesects the polygon area. <br> The image above shows the footprint of the all the [Sentinel-2 Raw granules](#sentinel-2-raw-granule) that are downloaded for the eruption named "`Etna_00`" in our database by using the white rectangular polygon. We define the collection of [Raw granules](#sentinel-2-raw-granule) that are downloaded for each of the rows of our database "[Sentinel-2 Raw event](#Sentinel-2-RAW-event)". <br> However, as you can see in the image above, most of the [Sentinel-2 Raw granules](#sentinel-2-raw-granule) in `Etna_00` [Sentinel-2 Raw event](#Sentinel-2-RAW-event) do not contain the volcanic eruption (big red spot) of interest (red rectangulars). Indeed, only the yellow and the pink rectangulars intersects or include part of the volcanic eruption. <br> In addition, the fact that one [Raw granule](#sentinel-2-raw-granule) intersects or include one event, this does not mean that the latter interesects or is included in all the bands of that [Raw granule](#sentinel-2-raw-granule). In particular,
since we use the bands [`B8A`, `B11`, `B12`] to detect wildfires and volcanic eruptions, we consider [Raw useful granules](#raw-useful-granule) those granules whose band `B8A` interesects the event. This is true for the yellow rectangular but not for the pink one (you need to trust us here, since the bands are not displaced in the image above).  We take the band `B8A` only because after the coregistration, the other bands will be moved to match the area of `B8A`.<br>
Finally, for some [Raw useful granules](#raw-useful-granule) part of the eruptions or the wildfire could extend until the top or the bottom edge of the polygon. In this case, some of the bands could be missing for a portion of the area of interest. To be sure that this is not happening, in addition to the [Raw useful granules](#raw-useful-granule), it is important to consider [Raw complementary granules](#raw-complementary-granule), which fills the missing part of the interest bands of the [Raw useful granules](#raw-useful-granule). <br> For each [Sentinel-2 Raw event](#Sentinel-2-RAW-event), the `THRAWS` dataset clearly states those [Raw granules](#sentinel-2-raw-granule) that are [Raw useful granules](#raw-useful-granule) or [Raw complementary granules](#raw-complementary-granule). However, the entire [Raw granules](#sentinel-2-raw-granule) collection is provided for each [Raw event](#sentinel-2-raw-event) to permit users that wants to use other bands to detect warm temeprature anomalies to do it.
