# PyRawS
Python for Raw Sentinel-2 data (PyRawS) is an open-source software providing utilities to open and process Sentinel 2 RAW data, which corresponds to a decompressed version of Level-0 data with additional metadata. The software is demonstrated on the first Sentinel-2 dataset containing raw data for warm temperature hotspots detection/classification.
