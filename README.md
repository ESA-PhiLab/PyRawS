## About the project
`Python for RAW Sentinel2 data (PyRawS)` is a powerful open-source Python package that provides a comprehensive set of tools for working with [Sentinel-2 Raw data](#sentinel-2-raw-data).
<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>
It provides utilities for coarse spatial bands coregistration, geo-referencing, data visualization, and image processing.
The software is demonstrated on the first Sentinel-2 Raw database for warm temperature hotspots detection/classification, making it an ideal tool for a wide range of applications in remote sensing and earth observation.
The package is written in Python and is open source, making it easy to use and modify for your specific needs.
The systme is based on [pytorch]("https://pytorch.org/"), which be installed with `CUDA 11` support, to enable GPU acceleation.


NB: What we call raw data in this project are Sentinel-2 data generated by the decompression and metadata addition of Sentinel-2 L0 data. Because of that, with the exception of the effects due to onboard equalization and lossy compression, they are the most similar version of the rawest form of data acquired by the satellite's sensors. Both the compression and equalization are applied onboard the satellite to reduce the amount of data transmitted to the ground station. For easy naming convention, this repo refer to the term "Raw" as the products decompressed with ancillary information appended.
